                                                          Microservices
In shor, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small 
services, each running in its own process and communicatioong with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP reource API....
contd.
small autonomous services that work together -Sam Newman
These services are built around business capabilities and independently deplloyable by fullly automated deployment 
machinery...contd
                                   MICROSERVICES
Advantages of microservicess:->new technology  & process adaption,dynamic scaling,faster release cycles.

centeralize micrservice configaration:-each micrservice is having a multiple environment. managing the configuration
individually for each application each environment is a very difficult think and thats where centeralize config come 
into picture.
spring cloud config server says:you put your all configuaration into git repository and i woulld take care of managing 
a configuration  and provindg into the specific micro service.
if limitsService says i want dev env. springCloudCongifServer provide it
if anotherService says i want other env. springCloudCongifServer provide it
springCloudConfigServeer act as centeralize microservice config serveer. 
you have to put all the configuration different enviroment in a git repository.and you cna connect springClouldConfigServer
into git repository.and it can be serve the configration based on the different needs of the different instancess in diff.
enviornment for all the micrservicess.

                               currencyCalculationServce
                                   Ribbonn=>NamingServer
 CurrencyExchangeService1    CurrencyExchangeService1     CurrencyExchangeService1


                              Ribbon Load balancing
in previous step we are configured ribbon we made ribbon load two instences of the CurrencyExchangeService
what ever service comming from currencyCalculationService we will be able to use ribbon and distribute 
currencyExchangeService1 and currencyExchangeService2 which one is running 8000, 8001 respectivly.lets 
assume you will start currencyExchangeService3 and launch it up 8002 will ribbon load to it right now think 
about to is .you have to add to the configuration you need to chnage application configuration when ever 
new server is created.that is not good. 
        so what i want to do based on the load i want to increase and decrease the number of the servicess
i want to dynamicaly increase and decrease currencyExchangeSeviceses thats were NamesServer comes in.
